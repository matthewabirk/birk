\title{MA Birkâ€™s Functions}
\description{
This is a compilation of functions that I found useful to make. It currently includes a unit of measurement conversion function, a Q10 calculator for temperature dependence of chemical and biological rates, and some miscellaneous wrapper functions to make R code shorter and faster to write.
